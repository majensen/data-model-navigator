# Standalone MDF Model Viewer

This package is a refactored, standalone version of the Bento
framework "Data Model Navigator" React component.

It is meant to be pointed at any arbitrary graph model specified by a
set of [MDF](https://github.com/CBIIT/bento-mdf) files, to create an
annotated data dictionary with an interactive graphical rendering of
the model.

To start it out of the box:

     git clone https://github.com/majensen/model-navigator-standalone
     cd model-navigator-standalone
     npm --legacy-peer-deps install
     npm start

which should open the model viewer onto the
[Integrated Canine Data Commons](https://caninecommons.cancer.gov)
graph data model.
